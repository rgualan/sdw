Statistical Downscaling Workbench

This web application, created as part of the project "Development of computational tools for downscaling of global circulation models and real-time flow forecasting", integrates a relational database of climate models and a set of downscaling computational tools based on artificial intelligence techniques.

The main functionality can be split in two modules: (1) ETL of climate data from global circulation models to a relational database; and (2) integration module for the  statistical downscalintg tools, which generically support the basic operations of training, validation and forecasting.

## Technologies
SDW was implemented using: JPA, ZK and Jersey.
